# tftargets

This package contains two datasets provided by TRED and ITFP:

* `TRED`: Predicted and known human transcription factor targets. (Source:
https://cb.utdallas.edu/cgi-bin/TRED/)

* `ITFP`: Predicted human transcription factor targets. (Source:
http://itfp.biosino.org/itfp/)

Install it from github with:
  
```{r}
devtools::install_github("slowikow/tftargets")
```

List the targets of a transcription factor called `STAT3`:
