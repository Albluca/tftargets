INTRUDUCTION
============

TRRUST is a manually curated database of human transcriptional regulatory
network.

Current version of TRRUST contains 8,015 transcriptional regulatory
relationships between 748 human transcription factors (TFs) and 1,975 non-TF
genes, derived from 6,175 pubmed articles, which describe small-scale
experimental studies of transcriptional regulations. To efficiently search for
regulatory relationships from over 20 million pubmed articles, we used
sentence-based text mining approach.

TRRUST database also provide information of mode of regulation (activation or
repression). Currently 4,861 (60.6%) regulatory relationships are known for
mode of regulation.

Tables for 748 human TFs and 1,975 non-TF genes included in TRRUST.
